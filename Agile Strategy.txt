Agile Strategy
--------------
The purpose of Agile
- SMART Goals
- managing the work to be done
- date and budget constraints
- monitor and adapt

1. Make Product Vision
   - 2-5 or more year destination goals.

2. Make product vision board
- contain vision statement at top to ralley team
- under this we have 4 columns target group,
   - target group needs
   - product needs 
   - business goals

3. Build Agile Roadmap
	- 4 Rows
	Time frame Now, Next, Someday
	Goals - What we are seeking, usually not measurable statements. 
         - Usually 2-3 goals
         - Focus on Goals, not features
  	Candidates - possible things to do to reach goals
  	Key results - metrics used to determine if goal is achieved

4. Monitor current state of the project
Quantitative metrics: baseline data about project
   - such as release time, # of errors, delays
   - when choosing metric ask: 
         - can it be accurate quantified? 
         - can we act on the metric? 
         - will it be relavent in the future?
Qualitative:
   - talk to management team to point out realities that dont show up in numbers 

- monitor current state with another chart
