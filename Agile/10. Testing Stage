Testing Stage


Testing Stack:
--------------

These tests are ordered from greatest number of tests needed,
and go up in cost as you go down the list.
1. Unit - tests unit of code to make sure it works as expected
		- almost all automated

2. Integration - making sure pieces of code work together properly

3. End to End - make sure meets user expectations

4. Exploration - testing from user prospective


- The more frequent releases, 
the more you need to invest in test automation

when making testing stack consider:
- reliability 
- easy test creation
- need for maintenance 
- integration with CI/CD stack

Dark launches may release updates to only small number of people
