Looking at Scrum Guide 2020

- teams must deliver a useable increment by end of 2 week sprint
  - doesn't need to be useful for customer but must be a complete
  software ready to ship
  - some groups dont release at end of every sprint, they wait for more
  increments

What is an increment?
Any PBI which is in done state.
  (PBI = tasks that need to be completed during Scrum sprint)
	Sprint review does not equal release gate. 
Team decides when to release
