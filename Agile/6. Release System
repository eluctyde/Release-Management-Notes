Release System


Dev environment > staging > production


3 Key Ingredients to good release:

1. Modular architecture - group similar features into smaller apps/components and build API contracts to communicate with these apps.
- can test each app before each release
- this means there are fewer moving parts in each app, therefore less major overhaul releases needed

2. Great relationships - 
	Developers can use these techniques to work better with others in co:
		a. Make bill of materials for each release clear.
				-bill of materials == list of all open source and third
				party components present in code base.
				-also lists licenses, versions, and patch status of components
		b. Provide link to issue tracker for each version of software released.
		c. Call out issues during push from dev environment to staging, to avoid issues pushing to production.

3. Automate Release Process
- start by automate release to staging
