Deployment Pipeline



A way to move code from version control to production.


Stages of deployment pipeline
1. Commit - pull request for new code addition to repo
          - run unit tests
2. Build app - create packages for deployment to desired environments
3. Quality control - run different tests
4. Deploy to testing or live environment

Some steps may be auto or manually done. Each pipeline is different.


Pipeline considerations
1. Build automation
2. Test automation
3. Deployment automation
