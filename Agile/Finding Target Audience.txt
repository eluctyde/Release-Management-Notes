Finding Target Audience

User Personas
--------------
Represent your customers with a variety of users who may use the software.

Make fake profiles of people which may contain:
imagined likes, dislikes, hobbies, hopes, experiences, location, education, age

Do's:
- mix instinct and data 
- get data from many sources
- be creative

Dont's
- don't worry about style, this is used internally only
- dont work in isolation, include marketing and design team, etc
- dont stick to one personal, make personas for each type of target group
- dont create too many, stick to main target groups, at most 4 or 5 who represent most important user groups

Steps to create personas:
1. Sketch out what you know and what want to know
2. Gather data (surveys are a good idea with social media campaigns)
3. Analyze data, try to find correlation with demographics and behavior
