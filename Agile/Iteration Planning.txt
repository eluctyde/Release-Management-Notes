Iteration Planning

In Agile, there are 2 main tactics to iteration planning:

Velocity based planning:
------------------------
 - The amount of work a team can do in current sprint, is roughly the same
 as the last sprint

 Steps:
 1. determine target velocity (ideal days or story points)
 2. sprint goals
 3. come up with "Stories" or major things needed related to goals
 4. split major actions into tasks and estimate time

Capacity or Commitment based planning:
---------------------------------------
1. Select sprint goal
2. come up with "story" to solve goal
3. split stories into tasks and estimate time
4. Ask the team for a commitment and team completes tasks and selects new
5. at the compare where they are at to previous sprint
