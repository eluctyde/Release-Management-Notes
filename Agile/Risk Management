Risk Management


4 Types of Risks that teams need to be aware of:

1. Value risk - does the user perceived real value from the new feature?
				- sometimes this is done with a test software in low risk environment

2. Usability risk - is it going to be easy to use? how does the feature
					 impact the established user workflow?

3. Feasibility risk - can we actually build it?

4. Business viability - cost of scaling and supporting?

See this image to see how you can put the above risks together to manage risks in each Scrum sprint:
